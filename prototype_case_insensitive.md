P: create a route within the backend that can search for things in a case insensitve manner
D: working with a slice of bytes using a SufixArray in the searcher struct. which uses methods on the suffixarray 

notes: ideally this would use the search function as it is and would only change one piece of the function as it is reusible.
I can make a function that returns different things depending on the route? or the query params?
