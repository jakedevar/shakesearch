Fork the Shakesearch project on GitHub and set up your development environment:
a. Clone your forked repository.
b. Install necessary dependencies for Golang and React.
c. Ensure that the existing project runs without issues.

Implement basic search functionality in the back end:
a. Set up a Golang API endpoint for handling search requests.
b. Implement a search algorithm to find relevant results from Shakespeare's works.
c. Return the search results in a suitable format (e.g., JSON).

Connect the front end to the back end:
a. Create an HTTP client in the React app to make requests to the Golang API.
b. Implement a search bar component that triggers a search request on user input.
c. Display a loading indicator while waiting for search results.

Display search results on the front end:
a. Design a component to display individual search results.
b. Ensure that the search results are displayed in a readable and organized manner.
c. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling if necessary.

Enhance the search functionality with additional features:
a. Implement a fuzzy search algorithm to handle misspellings.
b. Allow users to filter search results by work (e.g., play, sonnet).
c. Add autocomplete suggestions based on popular searches or known works.

Improve the front-end design and user experience:
a. Apply a responsive and clean design to the website.
b. Use appropriate typography, colors, and layout.
c. Ensure the website is accessible and performs well on various devices.

Thoroughly test the code and functionality:
a. Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
b. Handle bad inputs gracefully, providing error messages or alternative suggestions when necessary.
c. Perform manual testing to ensure everything works as expected.
d. Optimize performance and address any issues found during testing.

Plan and implement additional features based on user feedback or your own ideas.

Finalize the project and prepare for delivery:
a. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices.
b. Update the README with instructions for running the project and any new features.
c. Create a pull request on the original Shakesearch repository to contribute your improvements.

Review and iterate as needed, incorporating feedback and refining your code.
