so i have alot of really expensive operations and i would like them to be handled by a cache.
this will prevent really long page load times and be quite usefull
so...
1. install sqlite3
2. set up sqlite3
3. set up interface for sqlite3

REMEBER THAT SQLITE3 NEEDS CGO_ENABLED SET TO 1 AND GCC IS REQUIRED
