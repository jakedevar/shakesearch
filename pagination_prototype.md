i'm thinking about making a params struct that can parse out all the params without having to clutter the main file.
i'll pick it apart later. but this is seeming good actually. or at lease a params map or something

1. make a struct with the query names 
2. make a function that has all the peice miel logic in it to handle errors ect.
3. access params in later code
